# Monster Slayer Game Project ğŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ğŸ’¬

This Vue.js application creates a simple turn-based battle game. The game tracks player and monster health, manages game rounds, and records actions in a log. Players can attack the monster, perform special attacks, heal, or surrender. The game updates the health bars and determines the winner based on health values. Special attack availability is controlled by the round number, and the game restarts when needed. The application is mounted to the HTML element with the ID #game.
